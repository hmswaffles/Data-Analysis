     "input": "#WELCOME TO THE WIDE WEIRD WORLD OF COLOR \n\n#This notebook contains the tools necessary to a) investigate the xkcd color database, b) transform rgb values to perceptually even colorspaces,\n# c) Plot colors in 3d colorspace and d) compare with the results of the World Color Survey. If you are curious about what all of the 'happy' colors\n# aka 'happy blue', 'happy green', look like, what their perceptual center is, and how this relates to the munsell chips, you are in the right place.\n\n#there are also routines for converting RGB to CIELab and CIELove space, with various types of illuminants, primaries, and chromatic adaptations- the \n#RGB to XYZ coefficents are calculated in-house.\n#Additionally, there are tools for (some) linguistic analysis of the color terms\n#Towards the bottom, there is a routine for looking into the non-uniformity of the WCS stimulus, specifically looking at chromatic pop-out\n\n\n\n#The 7th cell below contains instructions for how to use these tools. I'd skip to that first.\n\n#thanks to the good folks at Enthought and the authors of the Mayavi package, Brent Berlin, Paul Kay, Randall Munroe, all those involved in the WCS or the XKCD color survey\n#and Terry Regier and the fine folks at the U.C. Berkeley Language and Cognition Lab. Especially Emily Cibelli.\n\n# Questions? email evanw@evanwarfel.com\n\n#This code is for academic/research purposes only, unless you contact me first.\n\n#----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#\n\n#A note on illuminants:\n#Berlin and Kay, 1969 used illuminant A\n#the WCS used the shady outdoors, which  d65 attemps to capture\n#however, the LAB values for the munsell chips in the WCS were calculated with the C illuminant.\n#note that all colorings of the 3d chips are only approximations.\n\n#########################################################\n#side note: the modal search is currently a bit buggy, and the chromatic adaptation/conversion between xyz/lab is not quite right",

This can be 'lcd','CIE','Adobe', or 'sRGB'\n#       4) either 'mean', 'mode', or '3d', depending on what you want to do\n#\n#\n#\n# Details:\n#CENTRAL TENDENCY MEASURE OPTIONS: \n#   A) 'mean', which returns the total number entries for each color term along with it's average and std deviation in both LAB and RGB coordinates\n#   B) 'mode', which snaps each color that was named to the nearest munsell chip and then counts said chips. This looks at the modal chips, because very rarely do the exact color coordinates overlap\n#   C) '3d' plots the named color coordinates against the munsell chips in 3d cielab space- see above for toggle options\n    \n# There are more, optional parameters in addition to the 4 above. They are as follows: \n    #Flag:        if set to True, the nearest chip searcher uses actual euclidean distance, rather than d^2. This is a speed shortcut.\n    \n    #Labeling:    if set to True, the focal colors will be labeled when graphed in 3d\n    \n    #Concat:      if set to True, multiple sql querys, aka. multiple color labels, will be plotted against the munsell chips if '3d' is also specified.\n    #                 if 'mean' is specified and concat is set to true then all the color labels will be treated as one color for analysis, instead of many\n    \n    #Lab:        if set to True, the 'mean' subroutine will return the mean of the lab coordiantes of all the colors, instead of converting them back to RGB\n    \n    #Screentype: selects which answers to select from the database based on what users reported thier screentype was. Can be 'lcd', etc. \n    #jmunchips:  if set to True, just the munsell chips will be plotted in 3d, w or w/o labeling. '3d' should still be specified\n    #meancoerce: if set to True, all entries per color name will be (perceptually averaged), then snaped  to the nearst munsell chip\n    #adaptype:   type of chromatic adaptation. can be 'brad' for bradford, or 'von kries'\n\n#Important- if the list colors contains more than 1 entry while graphing in 3d, concat should be set to true, else only the munsell chips will be plotted\n",
